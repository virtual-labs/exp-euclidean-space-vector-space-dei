1. On the first page of simulation, first step is to choose a point on plane.
2. To view the corresponding point in R<sup>2</sup> given a pair of axes, go to Step 2 on the same page.
3. On the same page, Step 3 provides the vector representation of the corresponding point in R<sup>2</sup>.
4. Press “Next” to go to the next page.
5. On the next page, choose the requisite tab either “ Addition ” or “ Scalar Multiplication ”.
6. Enter the values and press “Submit” button to see the result of the chosen operation.
7. 2<sup>nd</sup> box shows the location of the corresponding points and the 3<sup>rd</sup> shows the geometric representation.
8. Press the “Next” button to go to the next page or “Previous” button to go to the previous page.
9. Select value of n by pressing the appropriate tab to understand the Euclidean space for different values on n.
